ML Basics:

1. Supervised
Lables
Data Prepocessing
Checking for nulls
checking for missing values

lable encoding:
we convert those results into zeros and ones

one hot encoding:


Tokenization:
Srings to numbers

Data Ingestion
Fetching the data from csv files or sources

proper finilized data

Splitting data

Training Data - 80%
Testing data - 20%


Model Fitting
Skykit learn its a libery where we select particular model(Model selection)
	fitting model:
		which is used fit the model then we find out the accuracy and mean squared values
		
		Fitting
Overfitting									underfitting
Model Memorize the training data			Model fails to capture data patterns
performs poorly on testing data


2. Unsupervised
No-lables






Algorithms:

		Supervised									Unsupervised

	Classification									Clustering
1. Logistic Regression								K-Means Clustering
2. Support vector machine
3. XGBoost
4. Random forest

	Regression
1. Linear Regression
2.Gradient Descent(used for optimizing both regression and classification models)
